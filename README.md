Data and analysis scripts to accompany paper: "The social learning of gender roles: men report lower support for womenâ€™s empowerment when in front of their peers"

Data collected in Tanzania in summer 2023. 'ongoing_data_collection_checks.R' is a file we used in the field to periodically check that our conditions were balanced in terms of age/education/context of the participants.

Data files are split into the four conditions (elders, city men, solo/control, peers) and are in the data_finals folder

analysis.R includes data cleaning and analysis scripts

All outcome measures are attitudes towards statements relating to women's empowerment (1 - 5 Likert data). Sometimes they are written in favour of women's empowerment, sometimes against - so ratings are reversed coded when needed. 

All Likert data was analysed using ordinal models in the Rethinking package. All plots used in the paper are included in the plots folder, and were made using one of three plotting scripts available. 

ODK forms including the statements and instructions used on the tablets by the field team in Kiswahili and English are available on request. 

Supplementary material is available alongside the paper/preprint.
